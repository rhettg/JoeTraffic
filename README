JoeTraffic - Web-Log Analysis Application Utilizing the JoeAgent Framework
March 2004

This application was developed as part of a senior project by Rhett
Garber at California Polytechnique University, San Luis
Obispo. It is far from being a complete application, or really even
being useful for web-log analysis. JoeTraffic is merly a proof-
of-concept for the JoeAgent framework. I had initially invisioned
actually making this a realy application because I had some great
ideas that I have not seen implemented for web traffic analysis,
however, I have a real job now.

This application requires the JoeAgent library be found in the
python search path. It also requires MySQLdb and a mysql database.

This framework is being released under the GNU Lesser Public
License. As I understand I have full rights to be able to do
that, even though this was developed as a senior project for
Cal Poly.
